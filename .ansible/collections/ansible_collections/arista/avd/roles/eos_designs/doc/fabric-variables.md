# Fabric Variables

- The fabric underlay and overlay topology variables, define the elements related to build the L3 Leaf and Spine fabric.
- The following underlay routing protocols are supported:
  - EBGP (default for l3ls-evpn)
  - OSPF.
  - ISIS.
  - ISIS-SR*.
  - ISIS-LDP*.
  - ISIS-SR-LDP*.
  - OSPF-LDP*.
- The following overlay routing protocols are supported:
  - EBGP (default for l3ls-evpn)
  - IBGP (only with OSPF or ISIS variants in underlay)
- Only summary network addresses need to be defined. IP addresses are then assigned to each node, based on its unique device id.
  - To view IP address allocation and consumption, a summary is provided in the auto-generated fabric documentation in Markdown and CSV format.

*Only supported with core_interfaces data model.

## Flagging a Device as Not Deployed

- It is possible to provision configurations for a complete topology but flag devices as undeployed using the host level variable `is_deployed: false`.

  ```yaml
  # Use at the host level
  is_deployed: < true | false | default -> true >
- By default, this will have no impact within the `eos_designs` role. Configs will still be generated by the `eos_cli_config_gen` role and will still be pushed by the `eos_config_deploy_eapi` directly to devices if used.
- However, if the `eos_config_deploy_cvp` role is used to push configurations, CloudVision will ignore the devices flagged  as `is_deployed: false` and not attempt to configure them.
- If the device is not present in the network due to CloudVision not configuring the device, `eos_validate_state` role will fail tests on peers of the undeployed device trying to verify that interfaces are up.
- To overcome this and shutdown interfaces towards undeployed peers, the variable `shutdown_interfaces_towards_undeployed_peers` can be used, satisfying the `eos_validate_state` role interface tests. Again, this is only an issue if `eos_config_deploy_cvp` is used and the devices are not present in the network.
